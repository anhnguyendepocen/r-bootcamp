# Getting started


## Getting started
- Installing R
- Installing Rstudio
    - Getting to know the power of Rstudio
- Installing additional functionality


## What is R?

R is a programming language (Gnu-S)

R is an environment for statistical computing and graphics

R is not a "stats package"

It is never useful to ask if you can do something in R.  

- R's only limitation is your programming ability and creativity.


## Installing R

Installing R

- Pick a mirror (closer better but doesn't really matter.  0-Cloud is fine.)
- Pick an OS
  - Windows: Download base
  - MAC: first .pkg file
  - Linux: follow instructions according to your flavor

You now have a fully functioning statistical programming environment.

However... you will likely never need to use base R directly


## Installing Rstudio

Installing Rstudio

Cross-platform

 - Go to website
 - Download
 - Install

## Using Rstudio

Making programming easier

- Code completion
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Debugging

But lots more...


## Using Rstudio

- <mark class='emp'>**Web-enabled**</mark>
    - Interactive graphics
    - Create webpages, presentations (like this one) and more
- <mark class='emp'>**Projects**</mark>
- <mark class='emp'>**Built in version-control**</mark>
- Package development


## Multiple File Types

- R scripts
- R markdown
- Latex 
- Presentation
- General text/code editor that recognizes several other languages

## Web-enabled

Not only can you easily publish your efforts to html, you can even code directly in html, css, javascript etc.

The Rstudio group and others have a suite of packages devoted to interactive visualizations that often will require no more effort than standard plots


## Projects

Projects are a way to keep you research focused

Easily pick up where you left off

Easily switch from one project to another

Version control


## Version Control

Any project is able to take advantage of version control

- Git
- SVN

Among the many benefits, version-control provides peace of mind for research reproducibility, enhances collaboration, and allows one to keep on top of all the changes a typical research endeavor undergoes.
